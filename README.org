#+TITLE: Understanding Science as Art
#+AUTHOR: Chahak Mehta
#+DATE: 28 March, 2021

During my current work, and past experience too, I get overwhelmed by the math and theory of science. Many a times, everything just becomes a series of differential equations (and such) and I forget the underlying beauty of it. So, I have decided to try and maintain a collection of various visually interesting scientific simulations. I hope that it provides me a reminder of the bigger picture and at the same time, provide me the motivation to improve this collection.
